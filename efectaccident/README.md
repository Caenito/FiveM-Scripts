Resource that adds effect on crash. Strength of screen shake and time of effect depends of how much speed car lost or how much damage was dealt to it’s body. Works well with bleeding resource as this one is using different effects. Speed or damage loss needed to show effect as well as effect time can be easily configured in config.lua
